        <h1>Larry Page & Sergey Brin</h1>
          Larry Page and Sergey Brin were two Stanford University students who studied computer science. In 1995 they began working on a research project which was to
          explore the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, focusing on how webpages are interconnected. 
          <br>
          During this research they developed an algorithm called PageRank. PageRank analyzed and compared different websites by looking at their number and quality of
          links pointing to a webpage, this provided a way to rank webpages based on their importance and relevance. This was the beginning of the concept which Google
          would be built upon.
          <br><br>
          Before Google was known as Google, the name they gave it was BackRub. It operated on Stanford servers for a while, and showcased the power of their PageRank
          algorithm by delivering more relevant search results compared to other search engines at the time.
          <br>
          In 1998 they decided to start a company which they called Google, Google was a play on the word "googol" which refers to the number 1 followed by 100 zeros.
          Their first workplace was located in a garage in Mento Park, California.
          <br><br>
          When Google went public in 2004, it was a huge success which raised billions of dollars making Larry and Sergey billionaires and with this financial backing
          they expanded their services acquiring companies like YouTube and Android. They also launched products such as Google Maps and the popular web browser Google
          Chrome. 
          <br>
          Further on Google continued to innovate, developing products and services like artificial intelligence, cloud computing (Google Cloud) and self-driving cars.
          (Waymo).
          <br><br>
          Larry Page and Sergey Brin's vision, technical expertise and commitment were crucial in the creation and success of Google, making it an integral part of
          Internet's Evolution.

          <h1>My thoughts</h1>
          These days I don't think anyone could imagine a world without Google. <br>
          Google allows us to access information about nearly anything we can think of in an instant, made even more accessible as we can use google on any device that supports
          web browsers. This has evolved not only the internet, but also education. Students can do research on any subject without spending money on expensive litterature and
          even look at past studies made by other people. The possibilities are endless! <br>
          This comes with some risks, one of them being invalid or outdated information which is why we need to be careful which websites we source our information from.
          But I think that the pros far outweigh the cons, and I find it inspiring how two clever students came up with this revolutionary, innovative idea and made it a reality.
