        <h1>Evolution of the Internet</h1>
        Before the internet itself even existed, there was an idea of a global communication network. <br> The U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA for short,
        were the first to fund research for the developement of a communication system that was robust enough to withstand nuclear attacks in the 1960s.
        The project was called ARPANET and is often considered as the precursor to the internet. 
        <br><br>
        ARPANET sent its first message between two computers in different locations in the year 1969, thus the internet was born.
        They then laid the foundation for modern internet protocols as ARPANET was based on the concept of packet switching, where data was broken into packets and sent across a network.
        The next step in the evolution was the developemnt of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), which were developed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in the 1970s.
        TCP/IP allowed different computer networks to communicate with each other which formed the basis for the interconnected internet.
        <br><br>
        Then between the 1970s and the 1980s ARPANET continued to grow and connect more research institutions and universities, during that time networks such as NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network)
        also started to emerge which led to the interconnection of even more networks. This interconnection of various networks became known as the "internet".
        <br><br>
        In the year 1989 a man named Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW) while working at CERN. He was the creator of the first web browser that used HTML and web server software, which made it easier
        for people to access and share information on the internet. Following Tim Berner-Lee's invention came the commercialization of the internet in the 1990s, there was a rise in online services and e-commerce.
        1990s was the period that companies such as eBay, Amazon and Google emerged and contributed to the internet's rapid growth.
        <br><br>
        During these times the internet was not very fast, but that changed between the late 1990s and 2000s when the developement and widespread adoption of broadband internet greatly improved internet access speed.
        This enabled multimedia content, video streaming and online gaming. Now we have many ways to access the internet, one of the most popular on the go method being smartphones.
        With this popular access method came the social media applications like Facebook, Twitter (now known as "X") and YouTube which revolutionized how we connect, share content and collaborate.
        <br><br>
        The internet is ever evolving, many developements are ongoing such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality and web technologies like blockchain and Web3 which aim to create a more open
        and user-focused internet experience.
