        <h1>Agile Developement</h1>
          Agile developement is a methodology of software developement which focuses on flexibility, collaboration, customer feedback and continious improvement.
          It was created through the Agile Manifesto, a set of guiding values and principles created by a group of software developers in the year 2001.
          <br>
          Agile developement encompasses several developement methods, Scrum, Kanban and XP being the most popular.
          <br><br>
          Agile projects are divided into smaller increments allowing for continuous iterations and improvements, an iteration usually lasting a few weeks.
          This way of developing, iteration by iteration, makes it easier to adapt to changing requirements which is welcomed by Agile teams even late into 
          the developement process.
          The backbone of this approach is the continuous stream of feedback from customers, daily stand-up meetings and constant communication.
          <br><br>
          So how would you approach an Agile project? <br>
          Step one is preparation. During this step the product owner creates a backlog of the features they'd like to include in the final product.
          When this is done, the developement team estimates how long each feature will take to accomplish. 
          <br><br>
          Step two is the sprint planning. <br>
          The developer team has a meeting where they decide which features from the product backlog they are going to work on during the sprint. A sprint is a 
          set period of time during which the team must achieve a specific goal. A sprint is usually two weeks, but may vary.
          <br><br>
          Step three is the actual sprint. <br>
          During the sprint the team works on completing the tasks in the sprint backlog. During this step, the team may come across new issues that must be adressed.
          If this happens, the issues are added to the product backlog and prioritized accordingly.
          <br><br>
          After a sprint is successfully completed, the team holds a sprint review meeting where they demo the new features to the product owner.
          After this meeting, another meeting is held where they reflect on what went well and what didn't go as well during the sprint.
          <br><br>

          <h1>Agile Manifesto</h1>
          The agile manifesto values are as follows:
          <br><br>
          Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: <br> Agile values human communication and collaboration more than tools and processes.
          <br><br>
          Working software over comprehensive documentation: <br> While documentation is important, Agile prioritizes working, functional software.
          <br><br>
          Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: <br> Agile focuses on active collaboration with customers throughout the development process.
          Their feedback are crucial for the success of the project.
          <br><br>
          Responding to change over following a plan: <br> Agile encourages teams to adapt to changing requirements and priorities, ensuring that the product
          is always relevant.

          <h1>My thoughts</h1>
          It is clear to me why many developers choose to work according to the Agile methodology and follow the Agile Manifesto. I agree with all the values
          of the manifesto, being able to adapt to new requirements is important seeing as how trends change so suddenly and often, and the Agile method makes it more simple.
          By dividing the project into smaller pieces, I think it also boosts morale. A huge project might seem daunting at first, but by working on it one piece at a time 
          it makes it feel way more doable. 
          <br>
          Not to mention the upside of communication, being able to discuss and trade ideas with fellow developers makes any issues much easier to solve in many different ways.
          Ofcourse, I don't think any approach is absolutely free from problems or risks, but I see this as the most fitting way to work with developement.
